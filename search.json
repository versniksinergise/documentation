    "text": "The Sentinel-1 radar imaging mission is composed of a constellation of two polar-orbiting satellites providing continous all-weather, day and night imagery for Land and Maritime Monitoring. C-band synthentic aperture radar imaging has the advantage of operating at wavelenghts that are not obstructed by clouds or lack of illumination and therefore can acquire data during day or night under all weather conditions. With 6 days repeat cycle on the entire world and daily acquistions of sea ice zones and Europe’s major shipping routes, Sentinel-1 ensures reliable data availability to support emergency services and applications requiring time series observations.\nThe end of mission of the Sentinel-1B satellite has been declared in July 2022 On 23 December 2021, Copernicus Sentinel-1B experienced an anomaly related to the instrument electronics power supply provided by the satellite platform, leaving it unable to deliver radar data. Despite all investigations and recovery attempts, ESA and the European Commission had to announce that it is the end of the mission for Sentinel-1B. Copernicus Sentinel-1A remains fully operational. More information about the end of the mission for the Sentinel-1B satellite can be found on the webpage Mission ends for Copernicus Sentinel-1B satellite. In response to the loss of Sentinel-1B, the mission observation scenario of Sentinel-1A was adjusted, affecting the nominal global coverage frequency. An up-to-date overview of the observation scenario in place can be consulted on the webpage Sentinel-1 Observation Scenario. Some regions are currently not observed by Sentinel-1. All regions that are still observed now have a repeat cycle of 12 under a one-satellite constellation scenario, which affects possible interferometric analyses.\nSentinel data products are made available systematically and free of charge to all data users including the general public, scientific and commercial users.\nData products are available in single polarisation for Wave mode and dual polarisation or single polarisation for SM, IW and EW modes.\nThe table below indicates for each type of user level product, the format in which the data will be available, the access type (IAD or DAD), the spatial and temporal extent of the offer and from when the data will be available in the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem.

    "text": "The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission comprises a land monitoring constellation of two polar-orbiting satellites placed in the same sun-synchronous orbit, phased at 180° to each other. It aims at monitoring variability in land surface conditions, and its wide swath width (290 km) and high revisit time (10 days at the equator with one satellite, and 5 days with 2 satellites under cloud-free conditions which results in 2-3 days at mid-latitudes) will support monitoring of Earth’s surface changes.\nThe Sentinel-2 products are a compilation of elementary granules of fixed size, along with a single orbit. A granule is the minimum indivisible partition of a product (containing all possible spectral bands).\nFor Level-1C and Level-2A, the granules, also called tiles, are 100x100 km2 ortho-images in UTM/WGS84 projection. Download the Sentinel-2 tiling grid kml.\nThe UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) system divides the Earth’s surface into 60 zones. Each UTM zone has a vertical width of 6° of longitude and horizontal width of 8° of latitude.\n\n\nNote: The initial offer as from 01/2023 includes IAD access to the original Sentinel-2 Level-2A products generated by the ESA Copernicus Ground Segment for data acquired since December 2021.\nFor Sentinel-2 data acquired before December 2021 : the initial offer in IAD includes Sentinel-2 Level-2A products generated by ESA Copernicus Ground Segment and also Level-2A products generated by the CREODIAS using the Sentinel-2 Toolbox – identified by baseline 99.99 (“N9999” included in the product ID).  These products slightly differ from the products generated by the ESA Copernicus Ground Segment and are not visualized in the Browser. The products are compatible and can be downloaded for further processing or analysis.\n\nIn addition: IAD access to the new Sentinel-2 Collection-1 products (Level-1C and Level-2A) generated by the ESA Copernicus Ground Segment is available for data starting from December 2021 and proceeding in reverse chronological order of sensing time. These data are gradually made available as they are being generated as a part of the Sentinel-2 reprocessing campaign. More information about the campaign can be found on the dedicated webpage.

The Filter extension enables users to specify an additional parameter to filter on, while searching through data.\nThe syntax for filter is CQL2:\n{\n  \"filter\": {\n    \"op\": \"<operator>\",\n    \"args\": [\n      {\n        \"property\": \"<property_name>\"\n      },\n      \"<value>\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"filter-lang\": \"cql2-json\"\n}\nIt is also possible to use simple cql2-text:\n{\n  \"filter\": \"eo:cloud_cover > 90\"\n}\nThe available operators are eq, neq, lt, lte, gt, gte, between and not. Only and is currently supported as a logical operator. Be careful - different collections have different properties for the query filter available. The information describing this is available inside the documentation for each specific collection (ex. Sentinel-1 GRD).\n\n\nFields\nBy default, the search endpoint returns all the available attributes of each item. The fields extension provides a way for the client to specify which attributes should not be part of the output, making it easy for the client to not have to deal with unnecessary data.\nSyntax for the fields is:\n{\n  \"fields\": {\n    \"include\": [\n      \"<property_name_1>\",\n      \"<property_name_2>\"\n    ],\n    \"exclude\": [\n      \"<property_name_3>\",\n      \"<property_name_4>\",\n      \"<property_name_5>\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nInclude/Exclude behaviour\n\nWhen no fields attribute is specified in the request, all the available attributes will be included in the response.\nIf the fields attribute is specified with an empty object, or both include and exclude are set to null or an empty array is returned, the attributes for each item will be as if include was set to a default set of [\"id\", \"type\", \"geometry\", \"bbox\", \"links\", \"assets\", \"properties.datetime\"].\nIf only include is specified, the attributes in include will be merged with the default set above.\nIf only exclude is specified, the attributes in exclude will be removed from the default set above.\nIf both include and exclude are specified, the rule is that an attribute must be included in and not excluded from the response.\n\n\n\n\nDistinct\nSometimes we don't want to search for product metadata, but want some general information about the product, such as for example, which acquisition dates are available for Sentinel-1 inside the specified bbox and time interval. distinct attribute inside a search request makes this possible.\nSyntax for distinct attribute is:\n{\n  \"distinct\": \"<property_name>\"\n}\nAs with the filter attribute, distinct is also a collection limited to some specific properties. Information describing these properties can be found inside each collection's documentation (ex. Sentinel-1 GRD)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Sentinel Hub API uses OAuth2 Authentication and requires that you have an access token. In essence, this is a piece of information you add to your requests so the server knows it's you. These tokens do not last forever for a multitude of reasons, but you can get new ones and when they expire from the Sentinel-Hub OAuth2 server at the token endpoint listed below. But first, if you do not have one already, you need to register an OAuth Client in your account settings. This is so the server can expect you to make such token requests. If you do not have a Sentinel-Hub account, you can sign up for a free trial account.\n\nHow to use tokens\nOnce you have a token, do use it for authenticating all your requests within its validity period. While tokens do not last forever, they do last a reasonable amount of time, and sufficiently long that they can be reused. The information of how long each token lasts is embedded in the token itself in the exp claim, and can be read from there.\nDo not fetch a new token for each API request you make. Token requests are rate limited, so if you are getting an HTTP 429 error, that means you are requesting too many tokens.\nTokens are JSON Web Tokens (JWT), more information about them here or here.\n\n\nRegistering OAuth client\nTo register an OAuth client, open the \"User Settings\" tab in your dashboard, then click the Create new button (1) in the \"OAuth client\" section. Give your OAuth client a name (2), set the Client grant type to Client Credentials, and click the Create client button (3). Your client secret will be displayed. Copy the secret value (4) and paste it locally, as it will not be visible after the pop-up window closes! When you are finished, click Close (5). You should now see the newly created OAuth client name and ID (6) in the list of your OAuth clients. With client ID and client secret, you are now ready to request tokens.\n\nTo request tokens the easiest way is to have some software which understands OAuth2 and can make the proper request. For example, REST clients like Postman and Insomnia have support for OAuth2 Client credentials already included. See the Token Request Examples section below.\n\n\nOAuth2 Endpoints\nToken Endpoint - for requesting tokens\nhttps://sh.dataspace.copernicus.eu/oauth/token\nToken info endpoint\nhttps://sh.dataspace.copernicus.eu/oauth/tokeninfo\n\n\nToken Request Examples\n\ncURL\nThe following cURL request will return an access token, just make sure to replace <your client id> with your client ID and <your client secret> with your client secret:\nheaders = {\n    'content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',\n}\n\ndata = 'grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=<your client id>&client_secret=%3Cyour+client+secret%3E'\n\nresponse = requests.post('https://sh.dataspace.copernicus.eu/oauth/token', headers=headers, data=data)\n\n\nPostman\nIn the Postman request Authorization tab set the Type to OAuth 2.0 and Add the authorization data to Request Headers. Then click the Get New Access Token button. Set the Grant Type to Client Credentials, the access token URL to the token endpoint, then set the Client ID and Client Secret to the values of your OAuth Client. Scope can be blank. Keep Client Authentication as Send As Basic Auth Header. Click Request Token. You should get a new one immediately. To use this token to authorize your request, click Use Token. For more information see the Postman authorization documentation\n\n\nPython\nIn python the requests-oauthlib library can handle the retrieval of access tokens using your OAuth Client configuration.\nfrom oauthlib.oauth2 import BackendApplicationClient\nfrom requests_oauthlib import OAuth2Session\n\n# Your client credentials\nclient_id = '<client_id>'\nclient_secret = '<secret>'\n\n# Create a session\nclient = BackendApplicationClient(client_id=client_id)\noauth = OAuth2Session(client=client)\n\n# Get token for the session\ntoken = oauth.fetch_token(token_url='https://sh.dataspace.copernicus.eu/oauth/token',\n                          client_secret=client_secret)\n\n# All requests using this session will have an access token automatically added\nresp = oauth.get(\"https://sh.dataspace.copernicus.eu/oauth/tokeninfo\")\nprint(resp.content)\nrequests-oauthlib doesn't check for status before checking if the response is ok. In case there's a server error, the user can receive an incorrect error, which falsely makes it seem as if the issue is on client side. Library's compliance hooks will prevent the invalid status response from being ignored, returning the correct error. To use them, add the following code:\ndef sentinelhub_compliance_hook(response):\n    response.raise_for_status()\n    return response\n\noauth.register_compliance_hook(\"access_token_response\", sentinelhub_compliance_hook)\n\n\nJavascript\nExample using axios.\nimport axios from \"axios\"\nimport qs from \"qs\"\n\nconst client_id = \"<client_id>\"\nconst client_secret = \"<secret>\"\n\nconst instance = axios.create({\n  baseURL: \"https://sh.dataspace.copernicus.eu\"\n})\n\nconst config = {\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=utf-8'\n  }\n}\n\nconst body = qs.stringify({\n  client_id,\n  client_secret,\n  grant_type: \"client_credentials\"\n})\n\n\n// All requests using this instance will have an access token automatically added\ninstance.post(\"/oauth/token\", body, config).then(resp => {\n  Object.assign(instance.defaults, {headers: {authorization: `Bearer ${resp.data.access_token}`}})\n})"

We encourage you to limit your inquiries by geographic or temporal area.\nAll queries may be executed as simple HTTP-Get calls, by typing the query in web browser address line, by using any HTTP client, e.g. curl or wget, or from inside of users’ program. The database is accessible free and anonymously (open for anonymous access for everyone, no authorization is used) It may be accessed both from the internal network (virtual machines in Creodias) and from outside, e.g. your home computer. Note, that the actual EO data themselves are restricted to authorized users, only the Data Catalogue is open.\n\nGeneral Rules\nThe queries produce results in JSON format. Base url:\nhttp://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/resto/api/collections/search.json?\nMost queries are case-sensitive.\n\n\nCollections\nThe data are organized in so-called collections, corresponding to various satellites. A query may search for data in all collections, or in one particular collection only. If only one satellite is in the field of interest, the second approach is faster and more efficient, than filtering the general query. For example, to find 10 most recent Sentinel-2 products with cloud cover below 10%, the query should look like:\n$ wget -O - \"http://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/resto/api/collections/Sentinel2/search.json?cloudCover=[0,10]&startDate=2022-06-11&completionDate=2022-06-22&maxRecords=10\"\nwhile if the collection field is missing in the URL, the products from all the satellites are returned:\n$ wget -O - \"https://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/resto/api/collections/search.json?cloudCover=[0,10]&startDate=2022-06-11&completionDate=2022-06-22&maxRecords=10\"\nAs for today the following collections are defined and may be used:\nSentinel1 or SENTINEL-1\nSentinel2 or SENTINEL-2\nSentinel3 or SENTINEL-3\nSentinel5P or SENTINEL-5P\nNote, that collection names vary a bit from satellite names, as they are used in EO Data repository. For example, the collection is named Sentinel2, while in the repository its data are located within /eodata/Sentinel-2/…. branch of the repository tree.\n\n\nOutput sorting and limiting\nBy default, maximum 20 products are returned only. You may change the limit (beware of long execution time for queries about thousands of products) using the phrase\nmaxRecords=nnn\nIf the query is very general and the number of matching products is large, the next pages of products may be retrieved\npage=nnn\nYou may also change the order of how the products are presented, using the phrase like\nsortParam=startDate\nwill sort the output by observation date. The following orderings are implemented:\nstartDate - the date when the observation was made (start)\ncompletionDate - the date when the observation was made (end)\npublished  - the date when the product got published in our repository\neach of them may be accompanied by\nsortOrder=ascending or sortOrder=descending\nFor example the query\nhttp://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/resto/api/collections/Sentinel2/search.json?startDate=2021-07-01&completionDate=2021-07-31&sortParam=startDate&maxRecords=20\nwill return 20 products from July 2021, while the next query would return the next 20:\nhttp://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/resto/api/collections/Sentinel2/search.json?startDate=2021-07-01&completionDate=2021-07-31&sortParam=startDate&maxRecords=20&page=2\n\n\nFormal queries\nThe formal query is invoked as a sequence of sub phrases, separated by &. The result is a conjunction of all sub phrases. It is impossible to use an alternative in the question. The query must be specified as a formal query.\nThe example of formal query - about cloudless (cloud cover lower or equal to 10%) products for a specific location:\nhttps://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/resto/api/collections/Sentinel2/search.json?cloudCover=[0,10]&startDate=2021-06-21&completionDate=2021-09-22&lon=21.01&lat=52.22\nThe queries are in form param=value or param=[minvalue,maxvalue**]. Most of the parameters are common for all collections, but some are specific for some them (e.g. cloudCover** applies to optical satellites, but polarisation applies to radar ones), or just single one.\n\n\nGeography and time-frame\nThe common set of parameters are:\nstartDate, completionDate - the date limits of the observation. The time may also be specified, e.g. 2021-10-01T021:30:00Z\npublishedAfter, publishedBefore - the date limits when the product was published in our repository\nlon, lat - geographical position, expressed in military style (EPSG:4326, as decimal fraction of degrees, positive for eastern latitude and northern longitude) radius - region of interest, defined as a circle with centre in point determined by the longitude and latitude with radius expressed in meters (it won’t work with point manually selected in EOFinder/Data Explorer)\ngeometry - region of interest, defined as WKT string (POINT, POLYGON, etc.)\nbox - region of interest, defined as the rectangle with given (west,south,east,north) values\nbox is defined this way: &box=west,south,east,north\nFor example the query\nhttps://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/resto/api/collections/Sentinel2/search.json?cloudCover=[0,10]&startDate=2022-06-11&completionDate=2022-06-22&maxRecords=10&box=-1,1,-1,1\nor\nhttps://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/resto/api/collections/Sentinel2/search.json?cloudCover=[0,10]&startDate=2022-06-11&completionDate=2022-06-22&maxRecords=10&box=-21,23,-24,15\n\n\nVolatile features\nSome terrain-like feature masks are not permanent but describing a single scene only. The most commonly used such feature is cloudiness, or cloudCover, which is defined for most of the products coming from optical sensors. For example:\ncloudCover=[0,10]\nselects only those scenes, which are covered by clouds by no more than 10%.\nCaution: to be meaningful, the cloudiness must be provided with each product, while in many products is missing. If the cloudiness is unknown for the scene, it is marked by a value of 0 or -1. cloudCover=0 is therefore ambiguous: it may either mean totally cloudless sky or the cloudy scene for which cloud cover had not been estimated during original data processing.\n\n\nSatellite features\ninstrument - meaningful only for satellites equipped with multiple instruments. The possible values are satellite specific.\nproductType - the actual types possible are specific for every satellite.\nsensorMode - also satellite and sensor specific. E.g. (for Sentinel-1): sensorMode=EW\norbitDirection - ASCENDING or DESCENDING. For most heliosynchronous satellites descending orbits means the day scenes, while ascending means night ones. For many optical satellites (e.g. Sentinel-2) only day scenes are published.\nresolution - expected spatial resolution of the product defined in meters.\nstatus:\n\nONLINE\nOFFLINE\n\nSome additional parameters are strictly satellite-specific, e.g. polarisation, which is defined only for Sentinel-1\nFor every satellite (collection) its set of query-able parameters may be obtained by a query like:\nhttps://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/resto/api/collections/Sentinel1/describe.xml\nThe resulting XML file provides full list of the parameters for the collection, with their very brief descriptions."

    "text": "OData (Open Data Protocol) is a standard that specifies a variety of best practices for creating and using REST APIs. OData makes it possible to build REST-based data services that let Web clients publish and edit resources that are recognized by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and described in a data model using straightforward HTTP messages. ## Query structure\nAs a general note, OData query consists of elements which in this documentation are called “options”. Interface supports the following search options:\n\nfilter\norderby\ntop\nskip\ncount\nexpand\n\nSearch options should always be preceded with $ and consecutive options should be separated with &.\nConsecutive filters within filter option should be separated with and or or. Not operator can also be used e.g.:\nhttps://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/odata/v1/Products?$filter=not contains(Name,'S2') and ContentDate/Start gt 2022-05-03T00:00:00.000Z and ContentDate/Start lt 2022-05-03T00:10:00.000Z&$orderby=ContentDate/Start&$top=100\nPerformance note:\nTo accelerate the query performance it is recommended to limit the query by acquisition dates e.g.:\nContentDate/Start gt 2022-05-03T00:00:00.000Z and ContentDate/Start lt 2022-05-21T00:00:00.000Z\n\n\n\n\nTo search for a specific product by its exact name:\nhttps://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/odata/v1/Products?$filter=Name eq 'S1A_IW_GRDH_1SDV_20141031T161924_20141031T161949_003076_003856_634E.SAFE'\nTo search for products containing “S1A” in their names:\n[https://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/odata/v1/Products?\\(filter=contains(Name,'S1A') and ContentDate/Start gt 2022-05-03T00:00:00.000Z and ContentDate/Start lt 2022-05-21T00:00:00.000Z](https://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/odata/v1/Products?\\)filter=contains(Name,%27S1A%27)%20and%20ContentDate/Start%20gt%202022-05-03T00:00:00.000Z%20and%20ContentDate/Start%20lt%202022-05-21T00:00:00.000Z)\nAlternatively to contains, endswith and startswith can be used, to search for products ending or starting with provided string.\n\n\n\nIn case a user desires to search for multiple products by name in one query, POST method can be used:\nPOST\nhttps://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/odata/v1/Products/OData.CSC.FilterList\nRequest body:\n{\n  \"FilterProducts\":\n    [\n     {\"Name\": \"S1A_IW_GRDH_1SDV_20141031T161924_20141031T161949_003076_003856_634E.SAFE\"},\n     {\"Name\": \"S3B_SL_1_RBT____20190116T050535_20190116T050835_20190117T125958_0179_021_048_0000_LN2_O_NT_003.SEN3\"},\n     {\"Name\": \"xxxxxxxx.06.tar\"}\n    ]\n }\nTwo results are returned, as there is no product named xxxxxxxx.06.tar.\n\n\n\nTo search for products within a specific collection:\nhttps://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/odata/v1/Products?$filter=Collection/Name eq 'SENTINEL-2' and ContentDate/Start gt 2022-05-03T00:00:00.000Z and ContentDate/Start lt 2022-05-03T00:11:00.000Z\nThe following collections are currently available:\n\nSENTINEL-1\nSENTINEL-2\nSENTINEL-3\nSENTINEL-5P\n\n\n\n\nTo search for products published between two dates:\nhttps://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/odata/v1/Products?$filter=PublicationDate gt 2019-05-15T00:00:00.000Z and PublicationDate lt 2019-05-16T00:00:00.000Z\nTo define inclusive interval ge and le parameters can be used:\nhttps://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/odata/v1/Products?$filter=PublicationDate ge 2019-05-15T00:00:00.000Z and PublicationDate le 2019-05-16T00:00:00.000Z\n\n\n\nTo search for products acquired between two dates:\nhttps://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/odata/v1/Products?$filter=ContentDate/Start gt 2019-05-15T00:00:00.000Z and ContentDate/Start lt 2019-05-16T00:00:00.000Z\nUsually, there are two parameters describing the ContentDate (Acquisition Dates) for a product - Start and End.

If orderby option is used, additional orderby by id is also used, so that the results are fully ordered and no products are lost while paginating through the results.\nThe acceptable arguments for this option: ContentDate/Start, ContentDate/End, PublicationDate, ModificationDate, in directions: asc, desc.\n\n\n\nTop option specifies the maximum number of items returned from a query.\nTo limit the number of results:\nhttps://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/odata/v1/Products?\\(filter=contains(Name,%27S1A_EW_GRD%27)%20and%20ContentDate/Start%20gt%202022-05-03T00:00:00.000Z%20and%20ContentDate/Start%20lt%202022-05-03T12:00:00.000Z&\\)top=100\nThe default value is set to 20.\nThe acceptable arguments for this option: Integer <0,1000>\n\n\n\n\nSkip option can be used to skip a specific number of results. Exemplary application of this option would be paginating through the results, however for performance reasons, we recommend limiting queries with small time intervals as a substitute of using skip in a more generic query.\nTo skip a specific number of results:\nhttps://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/odata/v1/Products?\\(filter=contains(Name,%27S1A_EW_GRD%27)%20and%20ContentDate/Start%20gt%202022-05-03T00:00:00.000Z%20and%20ContentDate/Start%20lt%202022-05-03T12:00:00.000Z&\\)skip=23\nThe default value is set to 0.\nWhenever a query results in more products than 20 (default top value), the API provides a nextLink at the bottom of the page:\n\"@OData.nextLink\":\nhttp://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/odata/v1/Products?\\(filter=contains(Name,'S1A_EW_GRD')+and+ContentDate/Start+gt+2022-05-03T00:00:00.000Z+and+ContentDate/Start+lt+2022-05-03T12:00:00.000Z&\\)skip=20\nThe acceptable arguments for this option: Integer <0,10000>\n\n\n\nCount option enables users to get the exact number of products matching the query.

And with the reprocessing of Sentinel-2 happening in parallel (out of scope of this project), these will become available on this service as well.\n</div>\n\n\n\nIs it possible to download a subset of data corresponding to an AOI, instead of the whole image?\n\n\nYes, you will be able to download a subset of data, either using S3 interface, or dedicated APIs, i.e. Sentinel Hub, OpenEO when they become available. See <a href=\"#/Roadmap\">Roadmap</a> section of the documentation.\n</div>\n\n\n\nAre the data offered via Cloud Optimized Geotiffs (also Level 1)?\n\n\nSentinel-1 GRD data will be available in COG format. Sentinel-2 will stay in JP2 for the moment, as it is a similarly performant cloud optimised format.\n</div>\n\n\n\nWhen “on-line data” is mentioned, does that mean the data are not on tape?\n\n\nThe “on-line data” or IAD we are referring to, are indeed not on the tapes.  Tapes will still be there for redundancy reasons.\n</div>\n\n\n\nFor the S3 access in the free tier, will there be no cost for network traffic?\n\n\nS3 access will be part of free services as well, within the same constraints as the rest of the services.\n</div>\n\n\n\nCan we download the data acquired by all Sentinel missions (1, 2, 3, 5P, 6) and the other satellites (e.g. Meteosat) via the new interface? Some missions are not managed by ESA, but by EUMETSAT for example.\n\n\nInitialy Sentinel 1, Sentinel 2, Sentinel 3 and Sentinel 5P data up to L2 products will be available. Sentinel 6 data and data from Meteosat are currently not in the roadmap of the project. However access to Copernicus Contributing Missions CORE Datasets, Digital Elevation Models, data from Copernicus Services and additional data sets such as Landsat and ENVISAT and Belgian Collaborative Ground Segment hosted data are planned in the future. The <a href=\"#/Roadmap/DataTable.html\">Data Roadmap</a> shows how the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem will be continously upgraded and how more data will become available.\n</div>\n\n\n\nWill it still be the case that data is labelled as “on/offline” on the current legacy portal?\n\n\nThe vast majority of the data will be on-line : all Sentinel-2 L1C/L2A, Sentinel-1 SLC/GRD  and just about all other relevant data collections.\n</div>\n\n\n\nWill the new interface offer EO ready-to-use products or just L0 and L1 data?\n\n\nUp to L2 products will be available. The <a href=\"#/Roadmap\">Roadmap</a> shows how the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem will be continously upgraded and how more data become available.\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill there be an integrated free and commercial offering to support/encourage the transfer of the users from “try basics for free towards paid subscriptions”?\n\n\nYes, there will be a common user identity, which will allow registered users to seamlessly transfer between systems. This will also extend to other systems that will be added to the free tier to the commerical tier ecosystem in the future, assuming they will integrate it.\n</div>\n\n\n\nWhen we develop an EO ready-to-use product, could we integrate it into the interface and ask the payment from clients?\n\n\nYes, commercial services can be built on top, similar to Copernicus open license.\n</div>\n\n\n\nCan the user come with wish-list to services data products?\n\n\nUser can come with suggestions to improve or expand the service portfolio. A user forum will be set up and released by July to accommodate this.\n</div>\n\n\n\nAre you going to develop new services on DAS after July 2023?\n\n\nYes, a marketplace will be available where new Third party services will be able to onboard from July onwards to expand the ecosystem.\n</div>\n\n\n\nIs there any limitation on the max number of downloads at one time?\n\n\nYes, there will be quotas and constraints for different services.\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill there be an integrated free and commercial offering to support/encourage the transfer of the users from “try basics for free towards paid subscriptions”?\n\n\nYes, there will be a common user identity, which will allow registered users to seamlessly transfer between systems. This will also extend to other systems that will be added to the free tier to the commerical tier ecosystem in the future, assuming they will integrate it.\n</div>\n\n\n\nIf I’m having troubles with registering, what can I do?\n\n\nPlease e-mail the help-cdse-login@dataspace.copernicus.eu address for direct support on this matter.\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSNAP/gpt processing codes can be used in these on-line and cloud processing services?\n\n\nSNAP is integrated in cloud environment, and there will even be some dedicated on-demand services based on SNAP  (i.e. S1 processing to coherence, etc). \n</div>\n\n\n\nIs a STAC catalog planned ? Will the data be accessible on cloud object storage (S3)?\n\n\nSTAC Catalog API is indeed planned.  Note that the phase-in will take from end of January to July 2023.  So services will be added during this timeline, not everything will be available at the beginning. All the data will be available over S3 as well.\n</div>\n\n\n\nWill LTA process be discontinued when all archived data become online?\n\n\nThere will still be services available for so called “deferred data access” :  data collections that are not commonly used. That said, all most relevant collections will be available on-line.  The <a href=\"#/Roadmap\">Roadmap</a> shows how the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem will be continously upgraded and how more data become available.\n</div>\n\n\n\nWill the platform use STAC standards?\n\n\nYes, there will be STAC compliant Catalog API, as well as STAC items for individual products.\n</div>\n\n\n\nAny plan to offer the Pangeo platform for a “pythonist”?\n\n\nThis is currently not in the offer or roadmap.\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there any difference between EU users and non-EU users?\n\n\nThere is no difference between EU users and non-EU users. That said, there will be a continuity of the accounts with higher throughput, managed by ESA (i.e. Copernicus Services, International Hub, etc.).\n</div>\n\n\n\nWhich distribution channels will be available for high-throughput data access? I assume the public side (dataspase.copernicus.eu) has a bandwidth limitation. Or does the public side have user tiers, or is high-throughput data transfer (such as https://creodias.eu/remote-transfer-for-eodata) only a paid service?\n\n\nAll distribution options (i.e. OData, S3, Sentinel Hub,..) will be constrained with user quotas, which includes both bandwidth limitation, as well as monthly limits.\n</div>\n\n\n\nCan you give indictions about the cost of the “extra” services?\n\n\nPricing will be published soon.\n</div>\n\n\n\n This December advertisement of DAS says that “For those interested in processing, there will be scalable cloud resources available, optimized for EO tasks”. Does this refer to the current CreoDIAS resources, or something completely new that hasn’t been addressed yet? \n\n\nScalable cloud resources will be part of the commercial offering and can be obtained at <a href = \"https://creodias.eu/\">CREODIAS</a> in first instance. ICT-wise, there will be two options, including Open Telekom Cloud.\n</div>\n\n\n\nAre there tutorials (online & physical meetings) to use the new interface?\n\n\nTutorials will be added to the documentation in due time explaining the usage of the different interfaces. We will also be present on different conferences explaining the service & ecosystem.\n</div>"
